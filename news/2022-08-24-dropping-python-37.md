# Dropping Python 3.7

Conda-Forge has been providing support for Python 3.7 for 4 years now.

Increasingly projects are moving off it (particularly in the PyData
community). With Python 3.11's release coming around the corner (October
3rd), conda-forge plans to drop Python 3.7 support when Python 3.11
comes out. This will lighten the load on conda-forge infrastructure and
make room for the new versions the community would like to support.

More details can be found in issue
[conda-forge-pinning-feedstock#2623](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/2623). Feedback is welcome there.
