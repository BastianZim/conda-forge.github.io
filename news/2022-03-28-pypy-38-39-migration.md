# PyPy 3.8+3.9 Migration

We have begun rolling out packages built for PyPy3.8 and PyPy3.9. This
work may take a few weeks. See `pypy` in the user docs for information
on how to set up a PyPy environment. Please report issues to the PyPy
developers at https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy. We are also
dropping PyPy3.7 in each feedstock as the newer versions of PyPy are
added. New versions of migrated feedstocks will not be built for PyPy3.7
and that version of the python interpreter will not be receiving
updates. As usual, you can track the status of the migration on our
status page.
