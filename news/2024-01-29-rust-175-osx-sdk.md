# Rust 1.75 requires setting newer MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET

With the release of `rust 1.75`, we now require setting the minimal
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to at least `10.12`. You can do this by appending
`recipe/conda_build_config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:  # [osx and x86]
  - '10.12'                # [osx and x86]
```

You should also add a run dependency on the respective OSX version:

```yaml
  run:
    - __osx >={{ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET|default("10.9") }}  # [osx and x86_64]
```

The latter is also set automatically via a `run_exports` of
the `compiler('rust')` package, but we add this line if you would increase
the deployment target later in the feedstock for unrelated reasons.
