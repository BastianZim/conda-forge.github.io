# conda-forge Google Group is Now Read-only - Move to Discourse

We have made the conda-forge Google Group read-only. Please use the new
conda-forge [discourse
forum](https://conda.discourse.group/c/pkg-building/conda-forge/25), our
[Gitter room](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io), or
it's [Matrix/Element
counterpart](https://app.element.io/#/room/#conda-forge-space:matrix.org)
instead.
