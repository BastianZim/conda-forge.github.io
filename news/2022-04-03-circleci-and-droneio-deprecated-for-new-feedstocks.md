# CircleCI and Drone.io Deprecated for New Feedstocks

Due to technical issues in generating new feedstocks, we have deprecated
using CircleCI and Drone.io for builds of new feedstocks. Existing
CircleCI builds, if any, should be moved to azure. Existing Drone.io
builds can be moved to Travis CI or cross-compiled/emulated builds on
azure.
