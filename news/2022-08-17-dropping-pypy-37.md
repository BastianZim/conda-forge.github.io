# Dropping PyPy 3.7

Conda-forge has supported PyPy since almost 2.5 years now, and the
initial PyPy 3.7 builds have been superseded in almost all aspects by
the newer builds for 3.8 & 3.9. We are therefore dropping PyPy 3.7 as a
supported python version, and will keep focusing on the more
contemporary PyPy builds.
