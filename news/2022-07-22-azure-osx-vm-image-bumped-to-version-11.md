# Azure OSX VM Image Bumped to Version 11

Azure is removing their OSX 10.15 VM image and so we are bumping to 11.
You will need to rerender your feedstock to get this change. Feedstocks
without the new VM image specified will not build after Azure fully
removes the old image. Please get in touch with us if you have issues or
questions!
