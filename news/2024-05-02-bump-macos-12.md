# Azure macOS x64 runners will now default to `macos-12`

Azure Pipelines has deprecated the [`macos-11` images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/81eb448ee02647a9634bbba21d902b1424b31915/images/macos/macos-11-Readme.md). As a result we have [bumped](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy/releases/tag/v3.35.0) the default Azure `vmImage` setting to [`macos-12`](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/c7efc0685d959677c603acf49604c13396d854a3/images/macos/macos-12-Readme.md).
You can check [this issue](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/2067) for more details.
