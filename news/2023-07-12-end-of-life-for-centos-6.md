# End-of-life for CentOS 6

As you may be aware, we have delayed the deprecation of our CentOS 6 build system the `linux64`
platform several times. We have now set a formal deprecation date to be June 30, 2024. This date
matches the [end of extended life-cycle support](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4038291) from
RedHat for RHEL 6. After this date, we build packages against CentOS 7 by default for `linux64`.
